# Applied-Social-Network-Analysis-in-Python

WEEK_1:

Introduces you to different types of networks in the real world and why we study them. 
You'll learn about the basic elements of networks, as well as different types of networks. 
You'll also learn how to represent and manipulate networked data using the NetworkX library.

WEEK_2:

Learn how to analyze the connectivity of a network based on measures of distance, reachability, and redundancy of paths between nodes.

WEEK_3:

Explore ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network, 
using measures such as Degree, Closeness, and Betweenness centrality, Page Rank, and Hubs and Authorities.

WEEK_4:

Explore the evolution of networks over time,including the different models that generate networks with realistic features, 
such as the Preferential Attachment Model and Small World Networks.
